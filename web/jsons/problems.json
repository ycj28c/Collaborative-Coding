Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.\nExample:\nInput: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)\nOutput: 7 -> 0 -> 8\nExplanation: 342 + 465 = 807."

Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.\nThe string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on\nthe behavior of this function.\nIf the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.\nIf no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.\nNote:\nOnly the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.\nAssume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit\nsigned integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].
